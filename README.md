## About you!

Give a quick Intro!

- Whats your name?
- Whats your background?
- Why are you interested in Tableau?



## What is Data Analytics

A method of collecting information and *telling a story* with it to help make decisions. 

The data analytics role varies greatly from company to company but a lot of the core skillset is the same / very similar!


### Who uses Data Analytics

Probably ANY modern company.

### Common Analytic tools 

- Excel
- SQL
- Data Visualization tools (Tableau, PowerBI)

##### And sometimes:
- Python
- R

The Tools you use often depends on the company / clients you're working with.

## What is Tableau

Tableau is great for visualizing data and creating interactive dashboards.

Usually used for its Drag and drop approach to making visualizing data easier.


### Data Visualization Examples with Tableau

Lets take a further look at some of the things you can make with tableau!

Checkout [tableau public Gallery](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery) for a bunch of awesome examples. This is also where your tableau files will get saved when you use Tableau Public. To save locally you need to purchase a license or have an education version.

- [Graffiti removal](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery/graffiti-chicago?gallery=featured)
- [Malaria Deaths](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/gallery/malaria-africa?gallery=featured)

After the class make sure you explore more charts to get inspired, and see the full functionality of tableau! Downloading workbooks and reverse engineering them is GREAT way to learn more advanced techniques!

Notice how not only are the visuals great, but there are a lot of opportunities to be interactive with the data! This is super useful to give to teams or clients who want to be able to explore more on there own easily. 

Tableau can be incredibly powerful! And can be a super useful tool to have in your toolset as a Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, or Data Scientist. 

Keep in mind that this is just an intro course and we will only be scratching the surface what tableau is capable of. If you find it interesting keep learning! 

We have a part time Data Analytics class! you'll cover data analytics with Excel, SQL, and Tableau. The course also includes our Career Services support to help find a job. 


# Lets make things with Tableau!

For the next hour or so we're going to be Data Analysts! 

We have three clients that want answers about their data. 

We're going to look at 3 different datasets, and answer questions about them.

Tip: For these workshop we will be using data thats already in a good formatted, but when working with clients in the field be prepared to do a lot of data cleaning / reformatting!

I also put together step by step instructions for each project here. I know its hard to remember everything in a workshop. So make sure you save the page if you want to come back to it later! I'll also be adding more updates later this month. 


### Project 1

The city of Seattle wants to know understand how many bikes are going across the Fremont Bridge. And what time of the year is most popular. Can possibly shed some insight on why?

This project we will be using the [Fremont Bridge Data](https://data.seattle.gov/Transportation/Fremont-Bridge-Hourly-Bicycle-Counts-by-Month-Octo/65db-xm6k)

You can view step by step instructions of what we did [here](fremont-step-by-step.md)

Find the Completed Project [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/sage.elliott#!/vizhome/FremontBridge_0/Sheet1?publish=yes).



### Project 2

Seattle loves its bike data! Lets pretend we own this bike company and we want to know what the trend is in riders. This should be a pretty fast analysis. Its similar to the last one. This will be the last bite related project tonight!

- Pronto Bikes Seattle

### Project 3


Lets break away from Seattle data and look at the data from the Titanic.

This time we want to make a dashboard looking at several aspects of the titanic. 

- Where did people embark froom?
- How many people embarked from each place and what class were they?
- How did the death rate compare between classes?

Find the step by step instructions [here](titanic-step-by-step.md).
